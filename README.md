# sign-up-form
# Sign-up form for the Odin Project.

This form is based on everything learned to this point.
The idea is to style the form so when a future application needs
creativity in styling, the process is established in the mind.

The challenge is being able to deal with the "form" elements style attributes.
When styling is somehow stimied by the limitaions of the form, other methods are
employed to complete a task.

For this project I'm using Flexbox, Grid, and pseudo classes.
